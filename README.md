# The Software Engineer (Web Development)

This is an engineering path to transit from a beginner to a Senior software engineer.
This would be based on the engineering requirements of a principal engineer from my previous Company, my learning experience and the open source community,I hope to create an engineering path with free learning resources for each concept.

I would gradually add links and learning resources.
For concepts which I could not find a good free resource I would create one, any contributor can too.
This Guide should evolve into a more comprehensive structure, with projects and milestones.

The three Major Paths are

- Front-end
- Back-end
- Full-stack
