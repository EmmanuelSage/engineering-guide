# The Software Engineer (Web Development)

This is an engineering path to transit from a beginner to a Senior software engineer.
This would be based on the engineering requirements of my previous Company, my learning experience and the open source community, I hope to create an engineering path with free learning resources for each concept.

I would gradually add links and learning resources.
For concepts which I could not find a good free resource I would create one, any contributor can too.
This Guide should evolve into a more comprehensive structure, with projects and milestones.

The three Major Paths are

- Front-end
- Back-end
- Full-stack


## Front-end

### Core Computer Science

- Data structures and algorithms 

- Algorithmic analysis (time and space complexities for common algorithms/ Big-O notation) 

### Basic front-end languages/technologies/architectures 

- JavaScript, HTML and CSS

- HTML5 and CSS3 core features  

- JavaScript core concepts e.g Prototype inheritance, hoisting, scope, Event handling, Promises, async/await 

- JavaScript core data structures e.g objects, arrays, hash tables 

- functional programming features of JavaScript e.g lambdas/closures, higher-order functions 

- prototypal and class-based inheritance

- CSS Pre-processors i.e SASS/LESS

- JavaScript core language concepts e.g DOM manipulation, Fetch API, ES6 features

- Web storage API e.g session storage, local storage

- client-side storage i.e cookies

- browser caching techniques

- IndexedDB or WebSQL

- reactive programming paradigm.

- Object-Oriented Design principles e.g SOLID principles 

- GoF software design patterns and when/where they are applicable 

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.

- REST architecture e.g API endpoints, HATEOAS, etc.

- Common architectural patterns e.g MVP, MVC, MVI

- Design of Single Page Applications (SPAs)

### Frameworks

- Front-end frameworks e.g React, Angular, Vue

- CSS frameworks e.g Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Semantic UI

- Statically-typed JavaScript supersets e.g TypeScript, Flow

- Progressive Web Applications(PWAs)

- Service workers

- Web sockets

- WebRTC 

- Task runners e.g gulp, npm scripts

- Module bundlers e.g webpack, parcel

- State management mechanisms e.g Redux, Vuex, RxJS

### Workflow and Environment

- Version control tool e.g Git, Mercurial

- Code linting and formatting tools e.g ESLint, Prettier

- Code debugging and profiling tools e.g Chrome DevTools

- API testing tools i.e Postman.


### Security, Testing and Deployment

- Unit and integration testing and testing frameworks/libraries e.g Jest, Jasmine, Mocha

- Client-side form validation techniques.

- Using assertions for testing functionality

- BDD and TDD

- OAuth2 and JWT

- e2e testing.

- Client-side web security vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques e.g Cross-site scripting(XSS), cross-site request forgery(CSRF) 

- End-to-end and automation testing libraries e.g webdriverjs, cypressio, selenium, etc.

- Cloud hosting platforms e.g Heroku, AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean, e.t.c

- how CDNs work

- Linux Command Line/Terminal and/or Bash scripting.

- Networking conceptse.g DNS, HTTP, URL/URIs, TCP/IP, UDP, FTP
